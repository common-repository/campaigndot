CampaignDot allows to create normalized Email signatures (for Outlook, Mail, Thunderbird) for each member of your Wordpress website.

== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmQ54ba-O5E&t=8s

= Create and manage your Email signatures for Outlook, Mail, Thunderbird. =

CampaignDot uses users profiles to createcpixel perfect email signatures. You set your company's logo, colors, address, social network, that all your email signatures will use.

This information is global and will be used for all users of your wordpress website. 

A "Banner" submenu allows to manage a communication/marketing banner. Once you send each user their email signature, they just need to copy and paste into his signature in any mail client (Outlook, Mail, Thunderbird, Webmail…).

[Check out Campaigndot website](https://campaigndot.com/).
